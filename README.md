# Shiratori
// This challenge is an English twist on the Japanese word game Shiritori. The basic premise is to follow two rules:

// First character of next word must match last character of previous word.
// The word must not have already been said.
//A player who writes a word ending with the syllable N (ã‚“) loses.
//Words should be contain more than 4 letters.



//in this project i worked with the OOP in javascript that takes two method :


//play: a method that takes in a word as an argument and checks if it is valid (the word should follow rules #1 and #2 above).

// restart: a method that sets the words array to an empty one [] and sets the game_over boolean to false. It should return "game restarted".


//this project linked with the library jQuery in the javascript
